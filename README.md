## 📚 Module Summary

Nmap is used to identify and scan systems on a network. It plays a key role in network diagnostics and evaluating the security posture of network-connected systems. In this module, we dive deep into using Nmap effectively to:

- Identify live hosts
- Scan open ports
- Perform service enumeration
- Detect operating systems
- Bypass firewalls and IDS/IPS
- Use Nmap scripting for automation and advanced tasks
