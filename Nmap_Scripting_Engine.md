# Nmap Scripting Engine

The **Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)** is a powerful feature of Nmap that allows users to write and use scripts to automate tasks like service discovery, vulnerability detection, and brute-force attacks. Scripts are written in **Lua** and stored in various categories, allowing targeted and flexible scans.

---

## Script Categories

| Category    | Description                                                            |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `auth`      | Determines authentication credentials.                                 |
| `broadcast` | Discovers hosts via broadcast and can add them to scans automatically. |
| `brute`     | Performs brute-force attacks using known credential lists.             |
| `default`   | The default scripts run with `-sC`.                                    |
| `discovery` | Evaluates accessible services for further enumeration.                 |
| `dos`       | Tests for Denial of Service vulnerabilities (less used).               |
| `exploit`   | Tries to exploit known vulnerabilities on scanned services.            |
| `external`  | Uses external services for additional processing.                      |
| `fuzzer`    | Sends varied packets to identify input-handling issues.                |
| `intrusive` | May affect the target system; includes aggressive tests.               |
| `malware`   | Detects signs of malware or malicious behavior.                        |
| `safe`      | Non-intrusive scripts safe for general use.                            |
| `version`   | Enhances service version detection.                                    |
| `vuln`      | Identifies known vulnerabilities based on service fingerprints.        |

## Running NSE Scripts

### 1. Default Scripts

Run a scan with the default script set:

```bash
sudo nmap <target> -sC
```

### 2. Category-Specific Scripts

Run all scripts in a category:

```bash
sudo nmap <target> --script <category>
```

Example:

```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 --script vuln
```

### 3. Specific Scripts

Specify one or more individual scripts:

```bash
sudo nmap <target> --script banner,smtp-commands
```

Sample Output:

```bash
PORT   STATE SERVICE
25/tcp open  smtp
|_banner: 220 inlane ESMTP Postfix (Ubuntu)
|_smtp-commands: inlane, PIPELINING, SIZE 10240000, VRFY, ETRN, STARTTLS, ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES, 8BITMIME, DSN, SMTPUTF8,
```

These results show:

* The server runs **Postfix** on **Ubuntu**.
* Supported SMTP commands can assist in further enumeration.

---

## Aggressive Scan Option (-A)

This option combines multiple advanced scan features:

```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 80 -A
```

Includes:

* Service Version Detection (`-sV`)
* OS Detection (`-O`)
* Traceroute (`--traceroute`)
* Default NSE scripts (`-sC`)

Sample Output:

```bash
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.29 ((Ubuntu))
|_http-title: blog.inlanefreight.com
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.29 (Ubuntu)
|_http-generator: WordPress 5.3.4
```

This gives insight into:

* The web application and version
* The technology stack
* OS fingerprint

## Vulnerability Scanning

Use the `vuln` category to check for known vulnerabilities:

```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 80 -sV --script vuln
```

Sample Results:

```bash
| http-enum:
|   /wp-login.php: Possible admin folder
|   /: WordPress version: 5.3.4
| http-wordpress-users:
|   Username found: admin
| vulners:
|   CVE-2019-0211  https://vulners.com/cve/CVE-2019-0211
|   CVE-2018-1312  https://vulners.com/cve/CVE-2018-1312
```

| `--script <x>` | Run specified script(s) or categories             |
| `-A`           | Aggressive scan: combines several useful features |
| `-sV`          | Enable service version detection                  |
